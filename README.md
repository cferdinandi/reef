## Why use Reef?

Reef is an anti-framework.

It does a lot less than the big guys like React and Vue. It doesn't have a Virtual DOM. It doesn't require you to learn a custom templating syntax. It doesn't provide a bunch of custom methods.

**Reef does just one thing: render UI.**

Couldn't you just use some template strings and `innerHTML`? Sure. But Reef only updates things that have changed instead clobbering the DOM and removing focus from your form fields. It also automatically renders a new UI when your data updates, and helps protect you from XSS attacks.

If you're craving a simpler, back-to-basics web development experience, Reef is for you.

(*And if not, that's cool too! Carry on.*)



## Getting Started

### 1. Include Reef on your site.

**Direct Download**

You can [download the files directly from GitHub](https://github.com/cferdinandi/reef/archive/master.zip).

Compiled and production-ready code can be found in the `dist` directory. The `src` directory contains development code.

```html
<script src="path/to/reef.min.js"></script>
```

**CDN**

You can also use the [jsDelivr CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/gh/cferdinandi/reef?path=dist).

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/reef/dist/reef.min.js"></script>
```

Reef using semantic versioning. You can grab a major, minor, or patch version from the CDN with the `@1.2.3` syntax. You can find all available versions [under releases](<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/reef/dist/reef.min.js"></script>).

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/reef@5.0.0/dist/reef.min.js"></script>
```

**ES Modules**

Reef now supports modern browsers and module bundlers (like Rollup, Webpack, Snowpack, and so on) using the ES modules `import` syntax. Use the `.es` version.

```js
import Reef from 'path/to/reef.es.min.js';
```

<details>

<div>

**CommonJS**

If you use NodeJS, you can import Reef using the `require()` method with the `.cjs` version.

```js
var Reef = require('path/to/reef.cjs.min.js');
```

**AMD**

If you use RequireJS, SystemJS, and other AMD formats, you can import Reef with the `.amd` version.

```js
requirejs(['path/to/reef.amd.min.js'], function (Reef) {
  //...
});
```

**NPM**

You can also use NPM (or your favorite package manager).

```bash
npm install reefjs --save
```

</div>
</details>

### 2. Add an element to render your component/UI into.

This is typically an empty `div` with a targetable selector.

```html
<div id="app"></div>
```

### 3. Create your component

Create a new `Reef()` instance, passing in two arguments: your selector, and your options.

#### Provide a selector

The first argument is the selector for the element you want to render the UI into. Alternatively, you can pass in the element itself.

```js
// This works
var app = new Reef('#app');

// This does too
var elem = document.querySelector('#app');
var app = new Reef(elem);
```

#### Provide a Template

The second argument is an object of options. It requires a template property, as either a string or a function that returns a string, to render into the DOM.

You can use old-school strings, or if you'd prefer, ES6 template literals.

```js
// Your template can be a string
var app = new Reef('#app', {
	template: '<h1>Hello, world!</h1>'
});

// It can also be a function that returns a string
var app = new Reef('#app', {
	template: function () {
		return '<h1>Hello, world!</h1>';
	}
});
```

#### [Optional] Add State/Data

As an optional property of the options argument, you can include state for your component with the `data` property.

The state data is automatically passed into your template function, so that you can use it to customize your template. Reef also encodes any markup in your data before passing it into your template to reduce your risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

```js
// Some data
var app = new Reef('#app', {
	data: {
		greeting: 'Hello',
		name: 'world'
	},
	template: function (props) {
		return '<h1>' + props.greeting + ', ' + props.name + '!</h1>';
	}
});
```

### 4. Render your component

You can render your component by calling the `.render()` method on it.

```js
app.render();
```

## State Management

Reef provides two different ways to manage your state: reactive and manual.

### Data Reactivity

Data reactivity means that the UI "reacts" to changes in your data. Update your data, and the UI automatically renders any required updates based on the new state.

You can get an immutable clone of your current state using the `getData()` method. This lets you make any updates or changes you want without affecting the actual state of your component.

```js
var data = app.getData();
data.greeting = 'Hi there';
```

When you're ready to update your state, use the `setData()` method to update the state *and* cause the UI to render (if anything has changed).

The `setData()` method accepts an object with your changed state as an argument. You don't need to pass in the whole state again---only what's changed.

```js
// Pass in an entirely new state
app.setData({
	greeting: 'Hi there',
	name: 'universe'
});

// Or update just one key
app.setData({greeting: 'Hi there'});
```

**[Try data reactivity on CodePen &rarr;](https://codepen.io/cferdinandi/pen/RXeapE)**

### Manual State

Sometimes, you want more manual control over when your UI renders again.

You can update your component's state by directly accessing the `data` property of the component. After updating your state, run the `.render()` method again to update the DOM.

```js
app.data.greeting = 'Hi there';
app.data.name = 'universe';
app.render();
```

## Advanced Components

### HTML in your data

Reef automatically encodes any markup in your data before passing it into your template to reduce your risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

You can disable this feature by setting the `allowHTML` option to `true`.

*__Important!__ Do NOT do this with third-party or user-provided data. This exposes you to the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.*

```js
var app = new Reef('#app', {
	data: {
		greeting: '<strong>Hello</strong>',
		name: 'world'
	},
	template: function (props) {
		return '<h1>' + props.greeting + ', ' + props.name + '!</h1>';
	},
	allowHTML: true // Do NOT use with third-party/user-supplied data
});
```

**[Try allowing HTML in your data on CodePen &rarr;](https://codepen.io/cferdinandi/pen/LwgNyr)**


### Default and state-based HTML attributes

You can use component data to conditionally include or change the value of HTML attributes in your template.

In the example below, the checkbox is `checked` when `agreeToTOS` is `true`.

```js
var app = new Reef('#app', {
	data: {
		agreeToTOS: true
	},
	template: function (props) {
		var html =
			'<label for="tos">' +
				'<input type="checkbox" id="tos" ' + (props.agreeToTOS ? 'checked' : '') + '>' +
			'</label>';
		return html;
	}
});
```

You might also want to use a default value for an attribute, but not change it based on your component's state. You can do that by prefixing any attribute with `default` in your template.

In this example, `option[value="hermione"]` has the `[selected]` attribute on it when first rendered, but will defer to whatever changes the user makes when diffing and updating the UI.

```js
var app = new Reef('#app', {
	data: {},
	template: function () {
		var html =
			'<label for="wizards">Who is the best wizard?</label>' +
			'<select>' +
				'<option value="harry">Harry</option>' +
				'<option value="hermione" defaultSelected>Hermione</option>' +
				'<option value="neville">Neville</option>' +
			'</select>';
		return html;
	}
});
```


### Nested Components

If you're managing a bigger app, you may have components inside components.

Reef provides you with a way to attach nested components to their parent components. When the parent component is updated, it will automatically update the UI of its nested components if needed.

Associate a nested component with its parent using the `attachTo` key in your options. This accepts an array of components to attach your nested component to. You only need to render the parent component. It's nested components will render automatically.

You can access a parent component's state from a nested component by assigning the parent component `data` property to the `data` key in your nested component's options.

```js
// Parent component
var app = new Reef('#app', {
	data: {
		greeting: 'Hello, world!',
		todos: [
			'Buy milk',
			'Bake a birthday cake',
			'Go apple picking'
		]
	},
	template: function (props) {
		var html =
			'<h1>' + props.greeting + '</h1>' +
			'<div id="todos"></div>';
		return html;
	}
});

// Nested component
var todos = new Reef('#todos', {
	data: app.data,
	template: function (props) {
		var html = '<h2>Todo List</h2><ul>';
		props.todos.forEach(function (todo) {
			html += '<li>' + todo + '</li>';
		});
		html += '</ul>';
		return html;
	},
	attachTo: [app]
});

app.render();
```

### Attaching and Detaching Nested Components

You can attach or detach nested components at any time using the `attach()` and `detach()` methods. Both methods accept both individual components or arrays of components as arguments.

```js
// Attach components
app.attach(todos);
app.attach([todos]);

// Detach components
app.detach(todos);
app.detach([todos]);
```

### Shared State

There are two ways to handle shared state with Reef when your components (in addition to the [nested component/parent component relationship](#nested-components) documented above).

#### Source of Truth Object

You can associate a named data object with multiple components.

The biggest downside to this approach is that it's non-reactive. You need to [manually run the `render()` method](#manual-state) on any component that needs to be updated when you update the state.

```js
var sourceOfTruth = {
	greeting: 'Hello, world!',
	todos: [
		'Buy milk',
		'Bake a birthday cake',
		'Go apple picking'
	]
};

// Parent component
var app = new Reef('#app', {
	data: sourceOfTruth,
	template: function (props) {
		var html =
			'<h1>' + props.greeting + '</h1>' +
			'<div id="todos"></div>';
		return html;
	}
});

// Nested component
var todos = new Reef('#todos', {
	data: sourceOfTruth,
	template: function (props) {
		var html = '<h2>Todo List</h2><ul>';
		props.todos.forEach(function (todo) {
			html += '<li>' + todo + '</li>';
		});
		html += '</ul>';
		return html;
	},
	attachTo: [app]
});

// Initial render
app.render();

// Update the state
sourceOfTruth.greeting = 'Hi, universe';

// Re-render the DOM
app.render();
```

**[Try working with a single source of truth on CodePen &rarr;](https://codepen.io/cferdinandi/pen/pMxyPb)**

#### Create a Lagoon

A *lagoon* is a Reef instance that's only purpose is to store shared data.

It doesn't render any UI in the DOM, but allows you to reactively update state using the `setData()` method. You can automatically trigger renders in other components by attaching them to your lagoon.

Create a lagoon by setting the `lagoon` option to `true` when creating your Reef instance.

```js
var sourceOfTruth = new Reef(null, {
	data: {
		greeting: 'Hello, world!',
		todos: [
			'Buy milk',
			'Bake a birthday cake',
			'Go apple picking'
		]
	},
	lagoon: true
});

// Parent component
var app = new Reef('#app', {
	data: sourceOfTruth.data,
	template: function (props) {
		var html =
			'<h1>' + props.greeting + '</h1>' +
			'<div id="todos"></div>';
		return html;
	},
	attachTo: [sourceOfTruth]
});

// Nested component
var todos = new Reef('#todos', {
	data: sourceOfTruth.data,
	template: function (props) {
		var html = '<h2>Todo List</h2><ul>';
		props.todos.forEach(function (todo) {
			html += '<li>' + todo + '</li>';
		});
		html += '</ul>';
		return html;
	},
	attachTo: [sourceOfTruth, app]
});

// Initial render
app.render();

// Reactively update state
sourceOfTruth.setData({greeting: 'Hi, universe'});
```

### Custom Events

Whenever Reef updates the DOM, it emits a custom `render` event that you can listen for with `addEventListener()`.

The `render` event is emitted on the element that was update, and bubbles, so you can [use event delegation](https://gomakethings.com/checking-event-target-selectors-with-event-bubbling-in-vanilla-javascript/) if you'd prefer.

The `event.detail` property includes a copy of the `data` at the time that the template was rendered.

```js
document.addEventListener('render', function (event) {

	// Only run for elements with the #app ID
	if (!event.target.matches('#app')) return;

	// The data for this template
	var data = event.detail;

}, false);
```

**[Try the `render` event on CodePen &rarr;](https://codepen.io/cferdinandi/pen/XvxdRa)**

### Emitting your own custom events

Reef includes a helper function, `Reef.emit()`, that you can use to emit your own custom events in your apps.

Pass in the element to emit the event on and the event name as arguments. You can optionally pass in an object with event details as a third argument.

```js
// Emit the 'partyTime' event on the document element
Reef.emit(document, 'partyTime', {
	msg: 'It\'s party time!'
});
```

### Debugging

By default, Reef fails silently. You can put Reef into debugging mode to expose helpful error message in the Console tab of your browser's Developer Tools.

Turn debugging mode on or off with the `Reef.debug()` method. Pass in `true` to turn it on, and `false` to turn it off.

```js
// Turns debugging mode on
Reef.debug(true);

// Turns debugging mode off
Reef.debug(false);
```

## What's new?

**Version 4.0 adds better performance and XSS protection:**

- Data is once again automatically encoded to help protect you from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- Changes to diffing and rendering reduce reflows and improve performance.
- Support pushed back even further to IE9.
- *Deprecated:* Custom sanitizer methods were removed in favor of built-in, automated HTML encoding. You can still add custom sanitization within template functions.

**Version 3.0 removes built-in sanitization:**

- Automatic sanitization has been removed. *HTML templates are unsanitized by default.*
- Two new hooks to add sanitization to your components have been added. This provides more developer flexibility and keeps Reef as lightweight as possible.

**Version 2.0 adds a better sanitizing engine and markup support:**

- [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) is now the template sanitizing engine.
- The *attribute exceptions* feature has been removed in favor of DOMPurify's configuration options. The `addAttributes()` and `removeAttributes()` methods no longer exist.
- Reef now offers a smaller *unsafe* version for UIs that don't use any third-party or user-provided content. It does *not* sanitize templates before rendering, so use with caution.
- SVGs are now properly supported and will render correctly.

**Version 1.0 removed polyfill dependencies:**

- All polyfills have been removed and are no longer needed. This is a breaking change, as the `.polyfill` versions of scripts no longer exist.

**Version 0.2 introduced some big new features:**

- Data reactivity and automatically updating UI
- Support for nested components
- Shared state support (with data reactivity!)
- Custom attribute exceptions for your templates



## Browser Compatibility

Reef works in all modern browsers, and IE 9 and above.
